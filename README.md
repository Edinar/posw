<h3>About PoSWallet.com</h3>

https://poswallet.com is an online staking wallet serving up more than 70 of the most common PoS altcoins, along with block explorers and faucets for each coin. There are NO deposit or withdrawal fees for users - revenue is generated via a flat fee on staking plus initial coin listing fees paid by developers. Nearly 100,000,000 altcoins have been staked and distributed to user accounts over the past 14 months. 

Once the PoSW coin is launched, all profits will be paid to PoSW holders in the form of PoSW dividends.  We will cover the hosting/server/business costs with all extra profits returned to PoSW coin holders, in a transparent fashion. Proceeds from the coin pre-sale will pay for the development of new features, server upgrades and additions, and other business expenses that will make https://poswallet.com a one-stop-shop altcoin portal.

The goal of the PoSW coin is to maximize investor ROI by driving increased revenue through poswallet.com - rolling out new features, top notch customer service, and a crack marketing team will help drive to this goal.

<h3>PoSW Dividends</h3>

The dividend schedule is one of the main benefits of owning PoSW coins. Dividends will be paid out at the beginning of each month - these are in addition to the coins earned via the 1% stake rate. As described below, the total coin count will be kept at 250kk by burning coins from the dev address to balance the 1% proof of stake earnings by the users. Dividends will be sent to all addresses holding coins based on the earnings at poswallet.com for the previous month (plus any extra bonuses for said month). The dev PoSW address will not earn any dividends, further enhancing the user-purchased PoSW dividend ROI.

A hypothetical earnings situation is demonstrated in the chart below (assumptions include a 1kk starting PoSW balance on 1/1/2017, a static PoSW price over time, earnings growth of https://poswallet.com over time, and 50kk PoSW purchased by users before 1/1/2017. These are all assumptions for the sake of this example). 
The left axis (and blue bars) show the user PoSW balance over time while the right axis (and dashed line) show the ROI (return on investment) for the user in this situation.

The above chart is for demonstration and explanation purposes and is not a guarantee of any ROI.  We took our best guess based on poswallet.com monthly earnings performance and 5 years of bitcoin/altcoin experience among the PoSW team.

Dividends will be calculated (on a per address basis) by the formula: (address balance) / [(total money supply) - (dev address holdings)]. PoSW dev addresses will never earn dividends or stake after the coin launch. PoSW dev addresses will be identified publicly at launch.
